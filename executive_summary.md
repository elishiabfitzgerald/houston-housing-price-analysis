# Executive Summary

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether statistically significant differences exist in average home prices across low-, medium-, and high-priced ZIP codes in Houston, Texas.

## Data Overview
The dataset contained over 25,000 residential housing records and included variables such as price, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and ZIP code.

## Methodology
Due to violations of normality and unequal variances, robust statistical methods were applied:
- Data cleaning and median imputation by ZIP code
- Exploratory data analysis
- Welch’s ANOVA
- Tukey’s HSD post-hoc testing

## Key Findings
- Significant differences in average home prices were identified across all ZIP code price groups (p < 0.001)
- Tukey’s HSD confirmed each group differed significantly from the others

## Business Implications
ZIP code-level segmentation enables more accurate pricing strategies for buyers, sellers, and investors. Applying this approach can improve valuation accuracy and inform strategic real estate decisions.
